# Steelworks
GitHub page for the Steelworks mod

This mod is all about Steel and Steel-based items, and as such will eventually have somewhat long crafting trees

Will probably only be worked on by me (vizthex) because it was a small thing I started doing to get experience with C#, and as such will not be updated often (or have good sprites)

PROJECT HAS BEEN ABANDONED (might change later)

Current release: Av1.0 - https://github.com/RadianceDevelopment/Steelworks/releases/tag/Av1.0
