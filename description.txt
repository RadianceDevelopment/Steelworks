Steelworks is a mod that adds Steel and Steel-based items.

There's a Pickaxe, Axe, Sword, Bow, and planned Armour.

Since Steel is too tough to use for Magic weapons, there won't be any added.

Meant more for early/mid game than later in the game, as very few items are made past the Eye of Cthulhu/Eater of Worlds tier.
